find a way to have a win/lose thing happen:
 After each round (player's and cavemen's), you must check winning conditions. 
 If there are no stones remaining in any of the piles, the last player to go has lost the game.

 For some reason, it always says the comp loses 
 Prob an error in lossCheck() or nextTurn();
